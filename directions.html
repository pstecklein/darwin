            <h2>Rockets</h2>
            <p>1 on 1 rockets</p>
            <p>each hand players dealt 2 cards</p>
            <p>higher cards win</p>
            <h5>these are examples from lowest to highest cards</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>5 and 7</li>
                <li>9 and Jack</li>
                <li>pair of 2s</li>
                <li>pair of queens</li>
                <li>Aces</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Aces beat any hand in the game</p>
            <p>pairs of even the lowest value beat any mixed combination including a king and ace combo</p>
            <p>hold if you feel your cards will beat the computer/dealer</p>
            <p>drop if you don't have confidence in your hand</p>
            <p>2 and 3 are the lowest possible combination, but there's an exeption.</p>
            <p>If one player decides to hold on 23, and the other drops, the player with 23 wins regardless of the dealer hand</p>
            <p>if a single player holds and the other drops, and the holder beats the dealer, they take the pot</p>
            <p>If both players hold, the winner takes the pot and the loser has to pay double the current pot</p>
            <p>If a single player holds, but loses to the dealer, they double the pot</p>
            <h4>Each player starts with 10 chips. If a payer loses all their chips, they lose. No pay no play</h4>

            <p>Each player starts out with 200 HP, health can be affected in two ways</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Attacking: being attacked will negatively affect your health.</li>
                <li>Potions: Drinking a health potion will positively affect your health.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your strength is also a very important aspect</p>
            <p>The amount of strength in a player will determine how much damage they can deal per attack</p>
            <p>to increase strength, drink a strength potion</p>
            <p>Beware: a dodged attack will result in a slight decrease in strength of the attacker</p>
            <h3>Luck and Critical hits</h3>
            <p>Each round (Which consists of 1 attack each) a random luck statistic from 1 to 100 will be given to each</p>
            <p>The higher the luck statistic the better chance the attacker gets a critical hit, which deals extra damage</p>
            <p>Extreme low levels of luck can have side effects, for example, a very unlucky player who drinks a health potion can potentially be poisoned, resulting in a decrease in health</p>
            <h5>When you are on defense, you have 3 choices, each is a little it riskier than the next.</h5>
            <p>A counter-attack is the most risky, but it has highest reward where if you succeed, you will actually deal damage vs taking damage</p>
            <p>A block is the safest, it will gaarentee you take some damage, but the damage will be minimized</p>
            <h4>When a player's health gets to 0, they die, game over</h4>
            <p>However, since you always attack first, Darwin gets a chance to attack from the grave if you kill him directly after your attack. So the game can only end after your defense.</p>
